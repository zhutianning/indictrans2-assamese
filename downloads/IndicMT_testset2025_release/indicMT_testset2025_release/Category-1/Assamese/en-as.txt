Rohit’s men have time to unwind, train well and firm up strategies ahead of Boxing Day Test.
Over a month in Australia, India has seen it all.
The high at Perth, the low at Adelaide and the stalemate at Brisbane.
The Border-Gavaskar Trophy series is level at 1-1 and with two Tests remaining.
Rohit Sharma’s men will get extra opportunities to revive their campaign.
R. Ashwin’s sudden retirement has added another layer.
Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane lose their Test spots.
From the original core-group, Rohit, Virat Kohli and Ravindra Jadeja are still part of the mix.
In this series, Kohli found his voice at Perth before the old vulnerability around off-stump cropped up again.
Rohit, meanwhile, has strived but either succumbed to tough deliveries or erred in his judgement.
Jadeja, finally getting an opportunity at the Gabba, was rusty as a bowler and doughty as a batter.
With Ashwin’s exit, he becomes the number one spinner in terms of legacy within the squad.
K.L. Rahul’s consistency (235 runs averaging 47) and the lower-order’s pluck, has bailed out India.
To expect Jasprit Bumrah and Akash Deep to bowl incisively and also bat with gumption.
The duo, in a sense, saved the third Test by helping India avoid the follow-on.
Test meant that it became a rare contest which lasted five days.
It scuppered the host’s plans to maximise the value of a first innings score of 445.
However, India would be glad to have staged the great escape.
The coaching staff led by Gautam Gambhir have to find a way to choke Travis Head.
Australia will miss the services of an injured Josh Hazlewood but Scott Boland is a strong replacement.
Ajinkya Rahane’s men won that Border-Gavaskar Trophy series.
Opener Nathan McSweeney was dropped from the Australian squad.
According to a Cricket Australia press release, McSweeney makes way for Sam Konstas.
The 19-year-old opener scored a 107 against Rohit Sharma’s men.
Rohit Sharma’s last Test hundred came against England at Dharamshala.
Under Australian skies, Rohit Sharma is seeking a spot in the sun.
The runs have dried up, and under his leadership.
The second Test was lost at Adelaide before a doughty lower-order.
The rains helped snatch a draw in the third outing at Brisbane.
Rohit is aware about these mind games and has preferred to train hard and do what he can in the contests.
The Mumbaikar has endured a drought right from that match.
His scores so far in this tour have been 3, 3, 6 and 10.
However, in the away ODIs against Sri Lanka in August, he registered 58, 64 and 35.
He hung in with K.L. Rahul and on the next day, fell on 10.
Batters get judged on various factors but none more harsh when ageism and leadership become part of the scrutiny.
At 37 and with the Indian captaincy resting on him, it is no surprise that Rohit is being analysed threadbare.
In the same year in which he led India to the ICC T20 World Cup triumph.
Unlike Virat Kohli, whose hyper-energy lures the cameras, Rohit is more of a phlegmatic character.
Kohli, through his ton in the first Test at Perth, has gained a breather.
Steve Smith too had been going through the horrors, but his hundred at the Gabba gave him a lifeline.
Rohit needs to replicate this in the coming weeks as he could get four knocks spread across Melbourne and Sydney.
In the ODIs, his aggressive opening style meant that his fellow-batters could build further.
Rohit has to be patient and perhaps do a V.V.S.
Laxman by scoring vital runs and shepherding the tail.
He has the ability and it helps that his initial brownie points were scored while touring Australia in 2008.
With the series level at 1-1 and the fourth Test scheduled to commence at the Melbourne Cricket Ground here on December 26.
The Australian selectors have also added Sean Abbott, Beau Webster and Jhye Richardson to the squad.
Meanwhile, injured speedster Josh Hazlewood has been ruled out for now.
Scott Boland will replace him in the team.
The BCCI constitution states that any post lying vacant should be filled within 45 days by calling a Special General Meeting.
The upcoming BCCI SGM will be held within 43 days of the deadline.
The BCCI will hold a Special General Meeting (SGM) in Mumbai on January 12 to elect its new secretary.
The two posts were vacated by Jay Shah and Ashish Shelar respectively earlier this month.
Shah has already taken over as the youngest chairman of ICC on December 1.
Shelar, a seasoned BJP politician, has been sworn in as a cabinet minister in the recently-formed Maharashtra government.
As per the Lodha Committee reforms accepted by the Supreme Court, one person can't hold two positions.
Shah, who still had a year left in his BCCI tenure before the mandatory cooling off period.
Sean Abbott has endured a lot in life ever since that fatal bouncer to Phillip Hughes.
The Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) has brushed aside Prithvi Shaw's emotional.
A senior official of the MCA, while talking to PTI, claimed that the side was at times.
Shaw had expressed his frustration at not being picked in the 16-member squad for the Vijay Hazare Trophy.
We were playing with 10 fielders as we were forced to hide Prithvi Shaw.
The ball would pass near him and he would barely be able to get to it.
Even while batting, we could see he was troubled reaching to the ball.
His fitness, discipline and attitude are poor and it is pretty simple.
Even the seniors in the team have started complaining about his attitude now.
During the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, Shaw missed training sessions.
Shaw's teammate and Mumbai captain Shreyas Iyer too had issued a stern statement.
He has played so much of cricket. Everyone has given him inputs.
At the end of the day, it's his job to figure out things for himself.
Shaw was earlier left out of Mumbai's Ranji Trophy squad for similar reasons in October.
He was given a specific fitness program to work on at the MCA Academy.
Shaw broke into the scene amid a lot of hype, making his Test debut in 2018 as an 18-year-old.
The seamer, who is part of the current Australian Test squad, was practical about his chances.
His ODI and T20 International career has also failed to take off and he hasn't played any white-ball cricket for India since 2021.
Several former players have expressed their concern about his antics and attitude.
When Indian cricket team under Lala Amarnath played Australia after Gandhi's assassination.
